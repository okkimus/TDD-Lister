# TDD-lister

This is just me learning on testing and TDD on my own. Implementing the code mainly one test at the time with red-green-refactor principle. The goal is to implement code base that is easy to modify and maintain as the code coverage will be high.

In the app you can:

- [ ] create shopping lists
- [ ] mark items as found while shopping
- [ ] have autocomplete on most common items
- [ ] user authentication
- [ ] real-time shopping experience
